# PannableCamera

This camera is controlled with the mouse. You can pan it and it zooms with respect to the pointer.
I initially made it for my Game of Life implementation.
I think it's so commonly needed that somebody should make it a separate asset and share it.

I found the code for zooming on [gamedev](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com) I think, but can't find it anymore.
